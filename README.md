# Data Analytics Part 2
# Statistics for Data Science
Statistics is a branch of mathematics and a field of study that involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Its primary purpose is to extract meaningful insights, draw conclusions, and make informed decisions based on data. Statistics encompasses various techniques and methods for summarizing, describing, and drawing inferences from data, as well as for dealing with uncertainty and variation.
## Inferential Statistics - Hypotesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in statistics used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. It is a structured and formalized method for evaluating a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter. Hypothesis testing is the process of testing whether there is a significant difference or relationship between two variables or groups. One way is to use the T-Test.
- pvalue is the value resulting from calculating the differences from the study
- The T-test is used when you want to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of the group
- Alpha is used as an error tolerance limit in conducting hypothesis testing.
## Machine Learning - Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
# Create visualizations from data
## Data Visualization Using Python
Python offers several plotting libraries, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn and many other such data visualization packages with different features for creating informative, customized, and appealing plots to present data in the most simple and effective way.
## Matplotlib
- It is used for basic graph plotting like line charts, bar graphic, etc.
- It mainly works with datasets and arrays.
- Matplotlib acts productively with data arrays and frames. It regards the aces and figures as objects.
- Matplotlib is more customizable and pairs well with Pandas and Numpy for Exploratory Data Analys.
## Seaborn
- It is mainly used for statistics visualization and can perform complex visualizations with fewer commands.
- It works with entire datasets.
- Seaborn is considerably more organized and functional than Matplotlib and treats the entire dataset as a solitary unit.
- Seaborn has more inbuilt themes and is mainly used for statistical analysis.
## Difference Matplotlib and Seaborn in Data Analysis
1. Popularity and Abstraction:
- Matplotlib is one of the most basic and powerful data visualization libraries in Python. It provides low-level control over visual elements like plots, axes, and lines.
- Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Seaborn offers a higher-level and easier-to-use interface for creating attractive and informative data visualizations.
2. Default Style:
- Matplotlib has a default style that tends to be less aesthetically pleasing and requires more customization to produce visually appealing plots.
- Seaborn has a more visually appealing default style. This means you often get nicer-looking plots without much adjustment.
3. Statistical Charts:
- Seaborn has functions specifically designed for creating statistical charts like bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots with ease.
- Matplotlib requires more effort to create the same types of statistical plots.
4. Plot Creation Speed:
- Seaborn has an attractive default style and purpose-built functions, you tend to create good-looking plots more quickly.
- Matplotlib requires more custom code to achieve a similar look.
5. Chart Creation Time:
- Seaborn typically allows you to create plots faster due to its ease of use and better default styles.
- Matplotlib may require more custom code and, as a result, more time to produce similar plots.
6. Versatility:
- Matplotlib is a more general library, and you can create almost any type of plot you want with enough effort.
- Seaborn has a narrower focus on specific statistical data visualizations. If you need very specific types of plots, you may need to resort to Matplotlib.
7. Customization:
- Matplotlib offers extensive control over every aspect of a plot, allowing you to customize nearly every detail.
- Seaborn, while easier to use, may have limitations in specific customizations, especially if you require highly specific adjustments.
## Line Chart
A Line chart is a graph that represents information as a series of data points connected by a straight line. In line charts, each data point or marker is plotted and connected with a line curve.
## Bar Graph
When you have categorical data, you can present it with a bar graph. A bar graph plots data with the help of bars, which represent value on the y-axis and category on the x-axis. Bar graphs use bars with varying heights to show the data which belongs to a specific category.
## Histogram
A Histogram is a bar representation of data that varies over a range. It plots the height of the data belonging to a range along the y-axis and the range along the x-axis. Histograms are used to plot data over a range of values. They use a bar representation to show the data belonging to each range. Let's again use the 'iris' data which contains information about flowers to plot histograms
